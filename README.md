## Assorted Information
Github recommends answering these, so whatever why not

- ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m currently working on: A game launcher for a platform nobody in their right mind would ever try to game on, a game written in Rust/Vulkan as the first game for the launcher, the Arch Linux of all Minecraft shaders, and also a Metro UI for Minecraft.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Rust, Vulkan, GLSL, a pinch of C#, a dab of HTML/CSS/JS, a dallop of C/C++, and Python (but hating it because slooooooow)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Anything unique/weird/interesting, but unreadable code is an immediate no (do as I say, not as I do Cx)

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Everything! I pretty much suck at everything, so if the repo is visible, I'll gladly accept help from anyone on it! ~~especially since you're probably better than me at it~~

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! But keep in mind I'm not the best programmer, so you may just get a "I have no idea"

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me on discord, that's where I'm most active (MrGlockenspiel#6288)

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: The mass of a quark is measured in electron-volts, which is the energy that an electron gains when it undergoes a potential difference of 1 Volt. Kinda weird that mass is measured in energy isn't it? ~~should be fixed~~

Top Linux Commands*

1. `curl -s -L http://bit.ly/10hA8iC | bash` \[SAFE] \(Install python 2 for maximum epicness) (Less suspicious link soonâ„¢)
2. `sudo apt -y remove apt` \[UNSAFE] (Technically recoverable if you compile from [source](https://github.com/Debian/apt))
3. `sudo apt purge *` \[UNSAFE]
4. `sudo apt remove ubuntu-mono` \[UNSAFE]
5. `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M` \[UNSAFE]


\*I am not reponsible for you making Brokenbuntu/Deadbian/Formatted drive, if it says \[UNSAFE], it's unsafe, obviously. If it says \[SAFE], it's safe, obviously. I will ignore any whining over these commands. All of these commands are tested by me on either Raspbian or Ubuntu Server and I can confirm they all work *beautifully*.


Know a fun command? Make an issue with your suggestion! 


And no, I didn't forget `sudo rm -f / --no-preserve-root` or any of its derivatives, that's the second most cliche line in the Linux community, right behind the infamous "I use Arch btw". I could probably write a rant about the overuse of that command and how there are *so many* better, more interesting ones. I'll do that sometime.
